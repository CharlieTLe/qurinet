The scripts in this directory can be used to generate the link layer network 
topology of Qurinet. Each node has its adhoc interface configurations polled 
with the ``iwlist`` command. For each site, we need the channel and txpower 
of its two adhoc interfaces. Also, we scan for the available links on both 
interfaces with ``iwlist <dev> scanning''. The scripts are:

 getnodeinfo.sh - For each site pole the channels and txpowers of adhoc0 and
   adhoc1 interfaces. These values are dumped to stdout in CSV format. This 
   can be used to generate a site list for the topology program, i.e.: 
   ./getnodeinfo.sh >sites.csv. 

 getlinkinfo.sh - For each site, scan adhoc0 and adhoc1 with scan-site. You'll
   be prompted for the Qurinet password which will be passed to all the sites. 
   Careful!: if you type it wrong, it will tell you 'authentication failed' 
   for every site, which totally sucks! To kill this program, type ^Z to stop
   it, then type ``killall getlinkinfo.sh''. 

 scan-site <N> <I> [-i] - Run ``iwlist adhocI scanning'' at site N. The 
   output is parsed into CSV format with regular expressions. This particular 
   program is indiscriminate of network ESSID; it outputs all that it sees. 
   scan-site writes a file called N-I.csv to the working directory. ``sshpass''
   is used by default so that the script can be used with getlinkinfo.sh. To 
   get a password prompt, type ``./scan-site 10 0 -i''. 

 topology <sites.csv> [-m {channel, signal, quality}] - Generate network topology 
   from sites.csv produced by getnodeinfo.sh and the N-I.csv files produced by 
   getlinkinfo.sh. The link files are expected to be in the working directory. 
   By default, an adjacency list for all the nodes listed in sites.csv are is 
   dumped to stdout. If 'channel', 'signal', or 'quality' is passed as a 
   parameter, then an adjacency matrix separated by tabs is dumped to stdout.
   This can be redirected to a file imported into a spreadsheet. The edges are
   directional. Multipaths are listed in ascending order by channel number.

Have fun! -Chris 13 May 2013
